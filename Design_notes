Axes
j1 rotates around the Z axis while j2 and j3 rotates around the Y axis

Limits (for making arm's movements more stable and safe)
j1 180 degrees
j2 and j3 90 degrees

I added a damping of 60 to the each of the joints to reduce oscillating and swinging.

I added zero gravity to the links but removing them should not be a problem now it just helped me in the development phase.

I gave a 6 kg maass to base and 3 for links and also gaved 2 to 1 inertia values because of the size difference between the links and the base.

I used PID and gains 500p for 1 and 3 and 1000p for 2
